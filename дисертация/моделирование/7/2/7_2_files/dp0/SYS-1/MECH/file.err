 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.953   TIME= 23:41:23
 Material number 4 (used by element 2153 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.250   TIME= 23:41:23
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.281   TIME= 23:41:23
 Material number 4 (used by element 2153 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.344   TIME= 23:41:23
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 674) may have an 
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.344   TIME= 23:41:23
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 9) may have an   
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.344   TIME= 23:41:23
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.
