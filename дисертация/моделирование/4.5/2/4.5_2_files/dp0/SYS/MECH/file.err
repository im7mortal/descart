 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.906   TIME= 00:07:27
 KEYOPT(2) > 1 may only be used if KEYOPT(4) > 0 for CONTA174.           
 KEYOPT(4) = 2 is set.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.906   TIME= 00:07:27
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.938   TIME= 00:07:27
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.938   TIME= 00:07:27
 Material number 4 (used by element 2106 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.031   TIME= 00:07:27
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 806) may have an 
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.031   TIME= 00:07:27
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 7) may have an   
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.
