 Smoothing on certain target nodes (e.g.806) for pair ID 3 may have      
 accuracy issue.  Please verify element normal of connected target       
 elements (e.g.2223 & 2321).

 It is highly recommended to use the auto contact setting option by      
 issuing CNCHECK,AUTO command for this problem in order to achieve       
 better convergence.                                                     

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.250   TIME= 00:07:33
 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 3 and contact element type 3 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 4.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 ANSYS will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Contact algorithm: MPC based approach

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.250   TIME= 00:07:33
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 806) may have an 
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           
 MPC will be built internally to handle bonded contact.

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 4 and contact element type 3 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 3.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 ANSYS will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Contact algorithm: MPC based approach

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.250   TIME= 00:07:33
 Contact related post- process items (ETABLE, pressure ...) are not      
 available.                                                              
 Contact detection at: nodal point (normal to target surface)

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.250   TIME= 00:07:33
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 7) may have an   
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           
 MPC will be built internally to handle bonded contact.
 WARNING*: Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations    
 has been applied on certain contact nodes (for example 1703).           
 Overconstraint may occur.

 The resulting pinball region                  3.2388    
 Default target edge extension factor TOLS     10.000    
 Initial penetration/gap is excluded.
 Bonded contact (always) is defined.

 Max.  Initial penetration 0.786641338 was detected between contact      
 element 2248 and target element 2154.                                   
 You may move entire target surface by : x= 1.185443612E-02, y=          
 -0.786428181, z= 1.395647513E-02,to reduce initial penetration.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.250   TIME= 00:07:33
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              
 The reasons for possible overconstraint are:

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
