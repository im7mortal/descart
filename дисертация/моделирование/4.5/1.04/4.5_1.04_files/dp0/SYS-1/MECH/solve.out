 Smoothing on certain target nodes (e.g.1586) for pair ID 3 may have     
 accuracy issue.  Please verify element normal of connected target       
 elements (e.g.2347 & 2430).

 It is highly recommended to use the auto contact setting option by      
 issuing CNCHECK,AUTO command for this problem in order to achieve       
 better convergence.                                                     

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.719   TIME= 21:18:41
 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 3 and contact element type 3 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 4.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 ANSYS will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Contact algorithm: MPC based approach

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.719   TIME= 21:18:41

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.719   TIME= 21:18:41
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 1586) may have   
 an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or      
 split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.     
 MPC will be built internally to handle bonded contact.

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 4 and contact element type 3 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 3.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 ANSYS will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Contact algorithm: MPC based approach

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       1.719   TIME= 21:18:41
 Contact related post- process items (ETABLE, pressure ...) are not      
 available.                                                              
 Contact detection at: nodal point (normal to target surface)

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.719   TIME= 21:18:41
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 4) may have an   
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           
 MPC will be built internally to handle bonded contact.
 WARNING*: Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations    
 has been applied on certain contact nodes (for example 2388).           
 Overconstraint may occur.

 Default target edge extension factor TOLS     10.000    
 Initial penetration/gap is excluded.
 Bonded contact (always) is defined.

 Max.  Initial penetration 0.13615208 was detected between contact       
 element 2378 and target element 2263.                                   
 You may move entire target surface by : x= -0.134974733, y=

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.734   TIME= 21:18:41
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.

 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to
