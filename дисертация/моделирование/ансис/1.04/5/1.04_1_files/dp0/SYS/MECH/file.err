 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.500   TIME= 13:36:48
 KEYOPT(2) > 1 may only be used if KEYOPT(4) > 0 for CONTA174.           
 KEYOPT(4) = 2 is set.                                                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.594   TIME= 13:36:48
 Using 1 iteration per substep may result in unconverged solutions for   
 nonlinear analysis and the program may not indicate divergence in this  
 case.  Check your results.                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.891   TIME= 13:36:49
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.906   TIME= 13:36:49
 Material number 4 (used by element 2195 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.688   TIME= 13:36:50
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 3113) may have   
 an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or      
 split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.688   TIME= 13:36:50
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 42) may have an  
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.
