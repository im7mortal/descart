 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.953   TIME= 19:28:33
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.500   TIME= 19:28:34
 Material number 4 (used by element 15376 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      23.766   TIME= 19:29:01
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     473.859   TIME= 19:38:58
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 97%.       
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
