 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.000   TIME= 03:41:39
 Material number 4 (used by element 2259 ) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.359   TIME= 03:41:39
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.422   TIME= 03:41:39
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 1094) may have   
 an accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or      
 split the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.422   TIME= 03:41:39
 Smoothing on certain contact/target nodes (for example 9) may have an   
 accuracy issue.  You may switch contact and target surfaces, or split   
 the current pair into multiple pairs, or use Gauss detection.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.422   TIME= 03:41:39
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.
